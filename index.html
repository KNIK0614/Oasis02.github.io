            </h1>  
<p id="details"> Elon Musk is the charismatic chief executive officer (CEO) of electric car maker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX.
    Following a contested process, Musk completed a deal to buy Twitter in October 2022, becoming the owner of the social media company.
    Born and raised in South Africa, Musk spent time in Canada before moving to the United States.
    Educated at the University of Pennsylvania in physics, Musk started getting his feet wet as a serial tech entrepreneur with early successes like Zip2 and X.com, which merged with a company that became PayPal.
    Musk has behaved eccentrically from time to time. He has said he has Aspergers syndrome.
